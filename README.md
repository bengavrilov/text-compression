# Loseless Text-Compression Program
# Description #
This program allows a user to upload a .txt file and compress it to a form thats on average ~30% smaller in size whilst maintaining its original integrity. These encoded and compressed files cannot be opened like a normal .txt file. They must be stored appropriately until required for usage. Upon usage run the decoder to get the original .txt file.

Amongst every woman’s postpartum complications, arises the overshadowed effect of minimalized breastfeeding procedures, particularly in the African American demographic of females in the United States. The Ecology of Food and Nutrition academic journal delves into the specified sourcing of why African American women illustrate statistically uncommon infant feeding practices as a result of eccentric infant care ideologies. The study attempts to justify substandard rates of breastfeeding in young-to-middle aged African American women. The University of Florida’s very own accredited research team revealed that these reduced breastfeeding rates were influenced by cultural dispositions specific to African American women. In fact, the sampled group demonstrated a perceptual disconnect most likely rooted by ethnic disparities and a contrast in cultural beliefs shaped by historical habitual tendencies. The research article suggests that African American women are not necessarily challenged with a physical inability but are instead externally hindered to perform at the same standard, that is, to upkeep stabilized postpartum breastfeeding rates.
	The research study consisted of a diversified fleet of anthropologists in a joint collaboration with multiple departments within the University of South Florida, a specialized breastfeeding task force, and the Oasis prenatal center. The study was conducted on an applied medical anthropology approach and involved 20 of 34 women who were approached for participation. Common similarities among all participants included low income rates, single legal status, and what seemed to be a non-negotiable obligation to return to work shortly after birth. Data collection procedures consisted of hourly evaluations conducted by three team members in each participants’ respective home. The data collection window resumed from May to September 2015. This data was later drawn into play with Kroeger’s medical anthropological framework (Kroeger,  2002) for understanding health behavior in terms of predisposing, enabling, and service-related factors that influence decision-making (Deubel et al. 2019). The study revealed that the most prevalent factors discouraging African American women included: fears of infant dependency on breastfeeding, financial constraints influencing mothers to return to work shortly after childbirth , and a lack of a solidified support system to model successful breastfeeding and advocate for when postpartum complications arose. As with previous studies (Whipps,  2018), this study demonstrated a correlation between a mother’s breastfeeding rate and her educational credibility given that a quarter (5/20) of the sample group enrolled in higher education studies. Other aforementioned factors included accessibility roadblocks with electrical pumps. The study revealed that women would prefer to exclusively breastfeed given that the baby can consume breast milk even with the mother’s absence; however, electrical pumps are far out of financial reach for most of these participants.
	With complications rooting endlessly from various sources of impediment, the study isolated and addressed the most deterrent effect; , a mother’s fear of having an ‘overly-attached’ relationship with her offspring. The article presents that a heavy reliance on breastfeeding may hinder other logistical frameworks of raising a child. This includes further complications in providing childcare through other caregivers as the baby may become dependent on breast milk. Hopeful solutions such as introducing electrical pumps to provide the baby with its preferred food in their mother’s absence are impractical as electrical pumps are a financially scarce tool for many young mothers. Interestingly enough, there also exists a historical context that links the legacy of African American women in the US (Asiodu and Flaskerud 2011) to the deficient postpartum breastfeeding rates presented in this study.  
	The Ecology of Food and Nutrition decision in researching reduced breastfeeding initiation rates in African American women is one of great relevance as there is potential to reveal historical cultural diversity and a gap in psychological approaches to maternal caregiving. Infant nutrition is the backbone to developing a healthy physiological immune system. Breastfeeding offers the perfect amount of macronutrients required to sustain healthy immune, digestive, and respiratory function. It also contains important antibodies that boost immunity and help prevent babies from developing allergies. It is also important to note that shortly after birth, breast milk contains Colostrum which helps fight bacteria entering the host’s digestive system (Public Health Agency of Canada,  2015). Evidently, breastfeeding can reduce many health related complications in infants especially further into adulthood. Given its immersive health benefits, it is crucial that breastfeeding rates are monitored especially on an ethnocultural basis as it reveals gaps in maternal care ideologies. Upon understanding these different ideologies there is a practical takeaway in which different elements of these varied perceptions can form a universal standard for postpartum infant care.
	Postpartum caregiving is sought to be a life changing experience. It is often associated with maturity, independence, and a better understanding of one’s own self actualization. Most mothers will eventually agree that even with its most beautiful complexities, caregiving can be a very physically demanding and draining process. This statement holds particularly true 9-12 months postpartum. This is a window of oscillating emotions. Mothers are faced with life changing decisions; breastfeeding being an overlooked product. The study isolated recurring complications in African American maternal care. Many of which are challenged by humankind’s most subjective driving force, money. The study strongly suggested that a lack of financial flexibility was a forespoken pivot point for many mothers. Many of these mothers were challenged with unpaid maternity leave and about 95% (19/20) were planning on returning to work soon after childbirth. As discussed before, this forces mothers to shape infants into a more ‘manageable form’ so that it would allow for an easier transition to non-maternal caregiving. Intuitively, many mothers would dismiss the resumption of breastfeeding as it can develop dependent breastfeeding practices for infants. Electric pumps can aid in providing breast milk without a mother’s immediate presence, however, electric pumps are only accessible free of charge given the mother has a pre-existing insurance plan. This is most often not the case. The article exhibits a harsh but true reality in which breastfeeding practices are maintained over prolonged periods given that there is some form of financial stability. Given that only 25% of African American women in the study had completed any schooling beyond an Associate’s degree, it would render most of the remaining participants as unfit candidates for breastfeeding given its exhaustive financial costs.
	The article validates many legitimate drawbacks that African American women face during early caregiving, however, is it enough to generalize these presumptions based on the twenty participants channeled into this research study? The methodology of the study stated that the sample size consisted of only twenty participants. This is an immediate red flag as even the most well researched studies would never be validated for extrapolation to a general demographic (I.e, African American women in the USA) given it's particularly small sample size. The form of research presented in this article can be interpreted as a qualitative pilot study. The US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health suggests that a pilot study should concentrate on a 10% participant pool relative to the actual population size of the demographic being studied (Suresh and Chandrashekara 2012). Given the yearly average number of births by African American women is hovering between 550,000-600,000 in the United States (Martin et al. 2017), it is easy to see that the research presented in this study may not be an accurate representation of the demographic as a whole. Even with all its academic intricacies, this pilot study poorly structures its methodology. As concrete as the conclusions presented in this article are, the study is underpowered by its sample size and is statistically inconclusive.
	Methodology questionability aside, the discussion component of the research article raises extremely relevant interpretations. This includes a statistical framework of poor financial stability during the upbringing of infants and a historical context that focuses on the oppression of low-income African American women (Deubel et al. 2019). The article mentions the historical legacy of new mothers in African American families and how it has altered breastfeeding perceptions. Mentions of racial exploitation and slavery have introduced the principle of a bygone influence. This element was heavily overshadowed in the discussion component of the study. This standard of living has shifted African American families to adapt to alternative forms of postpartum care. Single mothers developed community oriented caregiving practices such as “wet nursing and bottle feeding to prevent babies from suffering in their mothers’ absence” (Deubel et al. 2019). History has shown us cultural practices and beliefs often contribute to contemporary cultural mannerism. The importance of financial stability can be reasonsed by average readers. It is largely the abstract and obscure subjects such as the history of African American caregiving that requires distinct clarification to empathize with its readers. Further research into the historical timeline of postpartum caregiving practices within the African American demographic can link contemporary breastfeeding deficiencies to its overlooked historical roots. 
	The Ecology of Food and Nutrition pilot study aimed at identifying causes impacting reduced breastfeeding initiation rates in early African American caregiving among young mothers. The study results demonstrated a common theme. Financial instability pressured many mothers in returning to work soon after birth as many of the participants could not afford a full maternity leave. This heavily swayed mothers into shifting to a more conventional and manageable form of infant food intake, formula. Other findings consisted of a lack of a peer support system to model ideal nurturing practices and advise for solutions when problems arose. The study also interestingly linked the role of African American women to its historical elements. Modern day caregiving practices by African American women were influenced by community based postpartum care whose focus was to lessen the burden faced by new mothers. It is clear that the statistics being addressed in this pilot study are largely dictated by an anthropological framework.
	The article depicts inevitable applications of many anthropological elements. An ongoing illustration of ethnic diversity, cultural pluralism, and cultural relativity is extremely relevant to the perceptions and differential practices of African American women during postpartum care. The very purpose of this article was to understand why breastfeeding initiation rates are the lowest within the African American demographic. The article labeled this as ‘abnormal’ and exclaimed that breastfeeding should be a common practice across all cultures. This is the very definition of cultural relativity. Cultural relativity suggests that what is accepted as right in one cultural group may be very wrong in another cultural group. Each culture interprets others behaviors in terms of their own culture. In this case, African American women have lower breastfeeding rates as they deem formula to better accommodate for their lifestyles. Hence, this results in backlash from other demographic counterparts as breastfeeding is more valued in these cultures. Traces of cultural evolution can also be applied to this context as African American mothers are forced to work soon after childbirth to accomodate for environmental factors (I.e, living costs).
	With many anthropological links present in the research study, it is evident that although humankind is a single species, it offers a diversified strain of subgroups that operate in contrasting manners. Cultural specificity allows us to interpret different forms of processing instincts which ultimately leads all subgroups of humankind to a common and shared goal, the preservation of one’s self and its offspring.
